"The impact of low quality identifier names on program comprehension is reasonably
well understood \cite{DeiBenbockPizka05,Lawrie2007,Lawrie2006}, but little is known
about the extent to which the quality of identifier names might influence the quality
of source code" \cite{ButlerWemelingerYu10}.

"Existing research on source code readability focuses on the contribution the
components of source code make to readability" \cite{Buse2008}.
