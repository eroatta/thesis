  abstract  = {Dynamic program analysis is a very popular technique for analysis of computer programs. It analyses the properties of a program while it is executing. Dynamic analysis has been found to be more precise than static analysis in handling run-time features like dynamic binding, polymorphism, threads etc. Therefore much emphasis is now being given on dynamic analysis of programs ( instead of static analysis) involving the above mentioned features. Various techniques have been devised over the past several years for the dynamic analysis of programs. This paper provides an overview of the existing techniques and tools for the dynamic analysis of programs. Further, the paper compares these techniques for their merits and demerits and emphasizes the importance of each technique.},

In this model, structural and behavioral design properties of classes, objects, and their relationships are evaluated using a suite of object-oriented design metrics. This model relates design properties such as encapsulation, modularity, coupling, and cohesion to high-level quality attributes such as reusability, flexibility, and complexity using empirical and anecdotal information. The relationship, or links, from design properties to quality attributes are weighted in accordance with their influence and importance. The model is validated by using empirical and expert opinion to compare with the model results on several large commercial object-oriented systems. A key attribute of the model is that it can be easily modified to include different relationships and weights, thus providing a practical quality assessment tool adaptable to a variety of demands.},
